# student-management
tried to create a student management system  
I gave more emphasis on the functionality part rather than UI 
all the data from the user is getting added to local storage and getting mapped to the dashboard
remove the button to remove student data from the database 
also have given some basic functionality like storing removed data in the trash in local storage  
counting the no of students in different courses like web16 and web17.
